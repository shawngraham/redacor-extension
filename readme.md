A fork of Mark Sample's 'redacor' extension, which, when you go to a gov website the extension will automatically remove all occurrences of the letter T, Q, and I from the page.

I always wanted to learn how to do this, so I've modified this version to replace 'woke' on any website and replace with 'basic human decency'.

Original readme follows:


# Redacor

 * To use, download the zip file and extract it.

 * Open Chrome and navigate to:
`chrome://extensions/`

* Enable Developer Mode: Toggle the "Developer mode" switch in the top-right corner.

* Load Unpacked Extension:
Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the unzipped redacor folder.

Now, visit any .gov website and the extension will automatically remove all occurrences of the letter T, Q, and I from the page.
